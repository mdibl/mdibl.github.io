## Welcome to the CGDS Core

The MDI Biological Laboratory's Comparative Genomics and Data Science Core is focused on collaboration, analysis, and education in the computational analysis of genome-scale data. Their efforts are distributed between the linked goals of (1) providing our collaborating research groups with experimental data analysis/management and computational resources, and (2) providing training in computational biology both within MDIBL and also as part of the Maine INBRE (IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence) research program.

Biomedical research is dependent on data management and increasingly sophisticated analysis workflows that are both rigorous and reproducible. The Core has the experience and knowledge to provide training, analysis, and infrastructure that enable our collaborating researchers to accomplish their research goals.
